2015Hack-HKUST

A project prepared for hackathon@HKUST, finished in 24hours

Hello, everyone. This is our project of Hackathon@HKUST 2015, which we called "Whiteboard digitalizer".

The basic idea comes from the fact that we are always struggling between focusing on lecture and writing down a delicate note. Our solution for this problem is casting the whiteboard, removing the lecturer and then post it to the website.
